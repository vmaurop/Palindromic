# Palindromic
Check if number or string is palindrome

Editor:Vim
Programming language:Ruby



Palindromic number:
palindromic number or numeral palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. 
Like 16461, for example, it is "symmetrical". The term palindromic is derived from palindrome, 
which refers to a word (such as rotor or racecar) whose spelling is unchanged when its letters are reversed. 
The first 30 palindromic numbers (in decimal) are:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, â€¦
Palindromic numbers receive most attention in the realm of recreational mathematics. 
A typical problem asks for numbers that possess a certain property and are palindromic




palindrome string:
A string is said to be a palindrome if the string read from left to right is equal to the string read from right to left.
For example, "iTi" is a palindrome, 
while the string "Oto" is not.(because O is different with o uppercase vs lowcase)
The following is an inductive characterization of a palindrome string:
the empty string is a palindrome
a string constituted only by a single character is a palindrome
